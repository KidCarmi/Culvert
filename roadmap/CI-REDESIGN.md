# CI/CD Redesign — Lane Architecture & Retirement Checklist

Status: **retirement steps 2–4, §3.9 docker-skip, AND steps 5–7 in
PASS-THROUGH MODE applied** (2026-07-03). The heavy installer/maint e2e
workflows are nightly + path-filtered on PRs; catalog-e2e and CodeQL are
PR-path-scoped; the QEMU image build no longer runs on PRs. Steps 5–7 were
executed **required-check-safe**: `qa-gate.yml` and
`security-release-gate.yml` keep their `pull_request` triggers and aggregate
check names (`✅ QA Gate — APPROVED`, `✅ Security Gate — APPROVED`), but on
PRs every heavy job skips and the aggregates (now `if: always()` +
skipped-as-pass) report success with a "superseded by Fast/Deep PR Gate"
summary — full behavior is unchanged on main pushes, tags, and the new
weekly scan cron. `code-review.yml`'s coverage-delta and build jobs are
deleted (tidy check moved into the Fast Gate's hygiene job).

REMAINING (repo-admin only): **step 1** — in Settings → Branches, require
`✅ Fast PR Gate — APPROVED` and `✅ Deep PR Gate — APPROVED`; once no rule
requires the QA/Security aggregate names, the two pass-through workflows'
`pull_request` triggers (and eventually the files' PR paths) can be dropped
in a trivial follow-up. **Step 8** — promote traffic-smoke after its
two-week flake-free window, then retire `proxy-pr-gate.yml`. This document
is the authority for what supersedes what. **CI-review fix pass applied (2026-07-03,
five-perspective agent review)**: P0s — qa-logic pipefail (main/tag QA gate
could green on failing tests), docs-only classifier carve-out for the
load-bearing SAML reference doc, auto-tag now waits for BOTH gate approvals
on the SHA before tagging (mechanical release gating; tag-echo re-runs
dropped from qa-gate/catalog/installer/maint workflows). Supply chain —
top-level permissions on all workflows, Dependency-Obituary SHA-pinned,
ref_name env-indirection, installer-script tag-pinned, dependabot covers
cmd/culvert-maint + docker. Filters — admin-plane (ui_*.go), upstream*.go,
update/backup/restore/geoip/events, .trivyignore, trust material
(trusted_root.json, release_identity.env), deep-gate self-validation.
Cost — ci.yml test/smoke PR-skip, proxy-pr-gate.yml deleted (triple
duplicate), buildx cache main-scope fallback, fuzz Mon/Wed/Fri, conditional
cancel-in-progress on ci.yml, nightly concurrency groups isolated.
Reliability — deep-gate trivy DB mirror, TEST_SEED everywhere, determinism
failure DX (seed + artifact), timeout-minutes on every job. **Hygiene batch applied
(2026-07-03)**: `.github/actions/needs-verdict` is now THE skipped-as-pass
aggregate (all four gate aggregates use it); `.github/scripts/
coverage-floor.sh` is THE coverage contract (Fast Gate + qa-gate share one
floors table); every job uses the `setup-go-cache` composite (31 direct
call sites migrated, GO_VERSION envs removed); playwright browsers cached.
STILL DEFERRED: classify-diff consolidation (the fast/deep filter sets are
intentionally different — reciprocal sync comments added instead, incl.
deep-gate↔codeql), release-matrix consolidation (release machinery, ~10
min/release payoff only).

## 1. Lane architecture

| Lane | Workflow | Trigger | Role |
|------|----------|---------|------|
| A — Fast PR Gate | `pr-fast-gate.yml` | every PR | **The** required merge check: fmt/vet/build (+arm64 compile, static-binary assert), golangci-lint, ONE full `-race` run owning both coverage contracts (global 55% + per-file floors), benchgate (allocs/op), govulncheck+gosec (pinned), gitleaks (runs even on docs-only PRs), maint-agent module (path-gated), traffic smoke (advisory) |
| B — Deep PR Gate | `pr-deep-gate.yml` | every PR, jobs path-gated | Required-if-run supplementary depth: build-image-once → trivy image + compose validation, hadolint, staticcheck, determinism (`-count=2 -shuffle`, triggered by any `*_test.go`), go-licenses on `go.mod/go.sum`, packaging (shellcheck/visudo/systemd) |
| C — Nightly/weekly | `proxy-nightly-e2e.yml`, `proxy-weekly-stress.yml`, `fuzz-nightly.yml`, `proxy-ui-e2e.yml`, `auth-idp-interop.yml` | schedule | Load, stress, leak, restart-under-traffic, benchmarks, coverage-guided fuzzing, UI e2e, IdP interop |
| D — Security assurance | Lane A fast trio + `codeql.yml` + `security-release-gate.yml` (until retired) | PR + schedule | SAST/deps/secrets/SBOM/SARIF |
| E — Release | `ci.yml` docker/catalog-pipeline/release/provenance path + `security-release-gate.yml` on tags | tags `v*`, main push | Multi-arch build, SBOM, cosign, SLSA, catalog gate, evidence |
| F — Installer/OVA | `install-lifecycle-e2e.yml`, `maint-agent-*-e2e.yml` + Lane B packaging job | PR (to be path-filtered), release | install/migrate/upgrade/rollback, agent lifecycle, appliance assertions |

Docs-only PR handling: neither PR gate uses workflow-level `paths:` filters —
a required check whose workflow never runs sits at "Expected" and blocks merge
forever. Instead a `changes` job classifies the diff (dependency-free
`git diff HEAD^1 HEAD` on the merge ref), jobs self-gate with `if:`, and the
always-running `*-approved` aggregates treat skipped as passing.

## 2. Duplication being removed (why the parallel phase exists)

Pre-redesign, every PR ran: **3×** the full `-race` suite (qa-logic ran it
twice internally + security-gate tests-race), 2 more full non-race runs
(determinism ×2 counts), 2 `-short` runs (coverage-delta), **~13** docker
image builds, four 35-minute installer/maint e2e jobs, multi-arch
arm64-via-QEMU builds that were never pushed, and CodeQL — with no path
filters anywhere except proxy-ui-e2e.

## 3. Retirement checklist (follow-up PR, after ≥1 green parallel cycle)

Time-box the parallel phase to **one week** — it costs roughly +50% CI spend.
Execute in this order; each ✂ step pairs a workflow change with a
branch-protection edit **in the same sitting**:

1. **Add `Fast PR Gate / ✅ Fast PR Gate — APPROVED` and
   `Deep PR Gate / ✅ Deep PR Gate — APPROVED` to required checks** once each
   has one green cycle. Do NOT remove any existing required check yet.
2. **Move the heavy e2e off the PR path first** (they dominate cost):
   - `install-lifecycle-e2e.yml` → `schedule` (nightly) + `push: tags v*` +
     PR `paths: [scripts/**, packaging/**, docker-compose*.yml, Dockerfile*]`
   - `maint-agent-backup-upgrade-e2e.yml` → same treatment
   - `maint-agent-update-e2e.yml` stays as the PR representative but gains
     the same `paths:` filter (it is advisory-by-paths, not required, so a
     workflow-level filter is safe here).
3. **Path-filter `catalog-e2e.yml`** (do not delete — it is the behavioral
   coverage for the release trust chain):
   `paths: [release_*.go, internal/**, test/e2e/**, Dockerfile, go.mod, go.sum, .github/workflows/catalog-e2e.yml]`
4. **Move `codeql.yml` off every-PR**: keep the weekly schedule + main push;
   add PR `paths:` for the security surface (same globs as Lane B's
   `security` filter) if PR-time CodeQL is still wanted.
5. ✂ **Retire `qa-gate.yml`** — superseded map:
   qa-logic/qa-coverage → Lane A `test-race`; qa-determinism → Lane B
   `determinism`; qa-infra-compose → Lane B `compose-validate`; qa-os →
   Lane A `hygiene` (static assert); qa-contract → covered by `./...` in
   Lane A; qa-agent → Lane A `agent` + Lane B `packaging`; qa-bench →
   Lane A `benchgate`. **Remove `qa-gate-approved` from required checks in
   the same change** — a deleted workflow's required check hard-blocks all
   merges at "Expected".
6. ✂ **Slim `security-release-gate.yml`** to tags/main-push/schedule only
   (it remains the release-time evidence gate): PR-time gosec/govulncheck/
   gitleaks now live in Lane A; trivy-image/hadolint/go-licenses in Lane B.
   Keep trivy-fs, SBOM, SARIF uploads, and the aggregate on the
   non-PR triggers. Update required checks if `release-approved` was required
   on PRs.
7. ✂ **Slim `code-review.yml`**: `lint` is superseded by Lane A (keep the
   reviewdog inline-comment variant only if the team wants inline comments);
   `coverage-delta` (two extra test runs) is superseded by Lane A's floors —
   delete or keep as advisory; `build` superseded by Lane A `hygiene`.
8. **`proxy-pr-gate.yml`** retires once Lane A's `traffic-smoke` is promoted
   (see §4).
9. **`ci.yml` constraints — do not violate:**
   - The workflow **name `CI` must not change** and the workflow must not be
     split in a way that changes its name: `publish-catalog-pages.yml`
     triggers on `workflow_run: workflows: ["CI"]`. Renaming it silently
     kills signed-catalog publication to Pages (the
     `CULVERT_RELEASE_CATALOG_URL` auto-seed origin). If it is ever renamed,
     update `publish-catalog-pages.yml` in the same PR.
   - The `docker` job on main-push/tags is **release machinery** (next-version
     compute, push/retag, cosign, `proxy_digest`/`version_bare` outputs
     consumed by `catalog-pipeline`, transitively gating `release`). The
     PR-only `_build-image.yml` reusable must never replace it.
   - Optional PR-cost win that IS safe: make the `docker` job build
     amd64-only (`push: false` already) on `pull_request` events, or skip it
     on PRs entirely now that Lane B builds+scans the image; verify
     `catalog-pipeline`'s `needs: [docker]` if-chain first.
   - Before restructuring the tag path at all, verify how tag-triggered runs
     fire today: `auto-tag` pushes tags with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which does
     **not** trigger workflows — confirm the actual release trigger chain
     (manual tags / PAT) before assuming `tags: v*` reproduces it.

## 4. Traffic-smoke promotion criterion

`pr-fast-gate.yml`'s `traffic-smoke` job is `continue-on-error: true` and
excluded from the aggregate's `needs`. Promote it (drop `continue-on-error`,
add to `needs`) after **two weeks of flake-free runs** across the nightly
proxy lane and the advisory PR runs — the workflow file itself says the
traffic-plane suite must prove stability first. Then retire
`proxy-pr-gate.yml` (step 8).

## 5. Required branch-protection checks (end state)

- `Fast PR Gate / ✅ Fast PR Gate — APPROVED`
- `Deep PR Gate / ✅ Deep PR Gate — APPROVED`
- (optional) `CodeQL / analyze` if PR-time CodeQL is retained on security paths

Everything else — nightly stress/load/fuzz, weekly IdP interop, UI e2e,
benchmarks, heavy installer e2e — is scheduled/advisory, and release-blocking
only via the tag-path gates.

### 5a. Release-gate integrity (PANW audit item 1 — REQUIRED admin step)

The signing/publish jobs (`docker`, `catalog-pipeline`, `release`) and
`auto-tag` gate on the gate **workflow files** concluding success for the
commit on its main push, via `.github/scripts/require-gate.sh` (bound to the
workflow path + main-push provenance — a spoofed check-run *name* or a
tag-triggered re-run of the same SHA can no longer self-approve). This is the
in-repo backstop.

It is a BACKSTOP, not the primary control. On the tag path `require-gate.sh`
is checked out from the **tagged tree**, so anyone able to push an arbitrary
`v*` tag can also strip the guard. The primary control is a **repo ruleset
that restricts `v*` tag creation to the `github-actions[bot]`** (i.e. only
`auto-tag` may mint release tags; humans cannot push `v*` at all):

> Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New tag ruleset → Target `v*` →
> Restrict creations → Bypass list: `github-actions[bot]` only.

Until that ruleset exists, a maintainer with push access can still hand-push a
tag on a *reviewed, green* commit (the in-repo guard allows exactly that and
refuses a non-green commit). Set the ruleset to close the arbitrary-tree class.

**Deferred (same class, Phase 2):** on a *main* push the `docker` job publishes
+ cosign-signs `ghcr:latest` in parallel with the gate, with no gate
dependency — a commit that later fails the gate has already shipped a signed
`latest`. Fix by gating the main-push publish/sign the same way (wait mode).

### 5b. Egress control on the signing jobs (PANW audit item 2)

The OIDC-token-bearing jobs (`docker`, `catalog-pipeline`, `release`, plus the
`_build-image` reusable, `pr-fast-gate/test-race`, and `publish-catalog-pages`)
run `go build`/`go test`/`docker build` over the full dependency graph while
holding the cosign signing identity. A compromised transitive dep could
exfiltrate that token. **Phase 2a (applied):** `step-security/harden-runner`
runs in `egress-policy: audit` as the first step of each — non-breaking egress
monitoring + a baseline for the block flip. golangci-lint is now installed via
checksum-verified `go install` (was `curl | sh` off a mutable tag ref).

### 5d. SBOM + reproducibility (PANW audit item 4)

The Dockerfile no longer runs `go mod tidy` at image-build time — the image
builds from the exact reviewed `go.mod`/`go.sum` (tidiness is enforced in CI by
the Fast Gate's `go mod tidy -diff`, not re-resolved in the image layer). All
Go builds (image, `test`, and the `release` matrix) now pass `-trimpath` as
reproducibility groundwork. **Caveat:** `-trimpath` is a build-input change, so
the first tagged release carrying it produces different binary hashes (and
therefore different SLSA subject digests) than prior releases — expected, not
tampering; note it in that release's changelog.

Every GitHub Release now carries **per-module CycloneDX SBOMs** for its binaries
(`culvert.sbom.cdx.json` + `culvert-maint.sbom.cdx.json`), generated once on the
linux/amd64 leg (syft reads the embedded Go build-info, identical across
GOOS/GOARCH). This replaces the prior state where the source-tree SBOM was a
90-day artifact falsely documented as "attached to every release" and the 7
released binaries had no SBOM at all. The SBOMs are Release *assets*, a channel
disjoint from the SLSA subjects, so the `aggregate-subjects` `==7` invariant is
untouched. The image already ships a BuildKit CycloneDX SBOM attestation
(`sbom: true`), so it is out of scope here.

**cosign 2.x→3.x bundle migration (DONE).** The pinned `cosign-installer@v4.1.2`
installs cosign **3.0.6**, which removed `sign-blob`/`attest-blob`'s detached
`--output-certificate`/`--output-signature` — so the binary/SBOM signing steps
were latently broken on the next tag (corroborated: release v1.0.0 shipped zero
binary/SBOM assets). Migrated to the cosign-3.x **new-format Sigstore bundle**
(`--bundle *.sigstore.json`, matching the catalog step) on all three paths:
- **Binaries** now ship a single `<binary>.sigstore.json` bundle instead of
  `.sig`/`.pem`.
- **SBOMs** are signed **standalone** with `cosign sign-blob --bundle`
  (`<sbom>.sigstore.json`, new-format Sigstore bundle). Deliberately NOT
  `attest-blob` with a binary subject: the SBOMs are per-**module** and shared by
  every arch binary, so binding one to a single binary's digest (e.g.
  linux/amd64) would make `verify-blob-attestation` fail the subject check for
  the arm64/darwin/windows binaries. A standalone signed SBOM verifies for
  consumers of any released binary.
- The cosign binary is explicitly pinned (`cosign-release: 'v3.0.6'`) on all
  Install-cosign steps so a future installer bump can't silently reintroduce the
  flag drift.
- **Operator impact:** `packaging/culvert-maint/install.sh` now verifies with
  `cosign verify-blob --bundle`, the verifier container default is bumped to
  `ghcr.io/sigstore/cosign/cosign:v3.0.6` (the correct GHCR path — the prior
  `ghcr.io/sigstore/cosign:*` reference was never a pullable image), and the
  local-binary override is `CULVERT_MAINT_BUNDLE` (was `CULVERT_MAINT_SIG`/`_PEM`).
  **Operators who pinned a cosign v2.x digest via `CULVERT_MAINT_COSIGN_IMAGE`
  MUST re-pin to v3.0.6** — a v2.x verifier cannot parse a v3 new-format bundle.
- No CI lane runs a real keyless verify (needs OIDC), so
  `cosign_bundle_migration_test.go` string-pins the bundle wiring on both the
  producer (`ci.yml`) and consumer (`install.sh`) as the regression guard.

**Follow-ups:** a single consolidated evidence-bundle tarball (SBOMs + provenance
+ scan reports + gate summaries per tag) is optional (those artifacts already
exist individually).

### 5c. DAST — attack the running product (PANW audit item 3)

`dast-nightly.yml` (scheduled) boots the real proxy and points scanners at it:
`testssl.sh` against the admin UI TLS (**gated** on legacy protocols / weak
cipher families — not on severity, since a self-signed cert is a legitimate
HIGH PKI finding), an OWASP ZAP baseline (advisory, passive), and a gosec run
with **G401 (weak crypto) + G402 (InsecureSkipVerify) re-included** (report-only
discovery of the surface the blocking gates' blanket exclusion hides).

The forged-leaf TLS posture of the **inspected path** — the product's core
function — is asserted deterministically + hermetically by
`TestMITM_ForgedLeafTLSPosture` (Go, default suite): TLS ≥ 1.2, AEAD cipher,
ECDSA P-256 leaf, and a TLS 1.1 client refused. An external scanner through the
CONNECT path is infeasible in CI (the shipped binary has no runtime
loopback-SSRF relax — that is test-only). `proxy.go`'s client-facing
`tls.Config` now pins `MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12` explicitly (was relying on
the Go default) so the floor is contractual.

**Follow-ups:** authenticated ZAP (session-cookie context — where the real yield
is); drive the G401/G402 discovery delta to zero with justified `#nosec` on the
remaining sites, then flip the **blocking** gosec to include them; add **HSTS**
to the admin UI (a `Strict-Transport-Security` header is not emitted today; CSP
already is, with a nonce) plus a Go assertion; a client-side
cipher **allowlist** on the inspect `tls.Config` (MinVersion is pinned; the
suite set still inherits Go defaults); optionally promote the ZAP/testssl
findings from advisory to blocking after a stable baseline.

**Phase 2b (TODO — flip to block after one real tagged release):** harden-runner
`block` is NOT applied yet because the Actions runtime/OIDC/cache use
per-region FQDNs under `*.actions.githubusercontent.com` that block can't
reliably match without an empirical baseline, and a wrong allowlist mid-pipeline
yields a *partial* release (images already signed to ghcr, release aborted).
Procedure: run one real `v*` release with audit on, read harden-runner's
reported endpoints, then set `egress-policy: block` + `allowed-endpoints` pinned
to those exact FQDNs. Known-required hosts (starting list, confirm against the
report): `github.com:443`, `api.github.com:443`, `uploads.github.com:443`,
`release-assets.githubusercontent.com:443`, `objects.githubusercontent.com:443`,
`codeload.github.com:443`, the reported `*.actions.githubusercontent.com` +
`*.blob.core.windows.net` FQDNs (Actions/OIDC/artifacts/gha-cache),
`ghcr.io:443`, `pkg-containers.githubusercontent.com:443`,
`proxy.golang.org:443`, `sum.golang.org:443`, `storage.googleapis.com:443`,
`fulcio.sigstore.dev:443`, `rekor.sigstore.dev:443`,
`tuf-repo-cdn.sigstore.dev:443`, `registry-1.docker.io:443`,
`auth.docker.io:443`, `production.cloudflare.docker.com:443`. Note: the
`docker` job's in-container build egress (apk, `go mod download` inside
buildkit) bypasses harden-runner — block there protects only the host-side
cosign step. The `provenance` job is an SLSA reusable workflow (`@v2.1.0`,
tag-pinned by design) — harden-runner cannot be injected into it; accepted gap.

## 6. Pinning policy

GitHub Actions: full commit SHA + version comment (enforced convention).
Go-installed tools: exact versions (gosec v2.27.1, govulncheck v1.5.0,
go-licenses v1.6.0, staticcheck 2025.1, golangci-lint v2.5.0). Exception:
`benchstat@latest` — `golang.org/x/perf` publishes no tagged releases and it
only feeds the informational weekly diff. Known remaining unpinned ref:
`KidCarmi/Dependency-Obituary@main` (first-party, advisory,
continue-on-error).

## 7. Expected PR wall-time

| Scenario | Before | After retirement |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| Docs-only PR | ~40–60 min of jobs | gitleaks + aggregates (~2 min) |
| Typical Go PR | ~40–60 min | ~10–15 min (bounded by the single `-race` run) |
| Proxy/security/deps PR | ~40–60 min | ~20–30 min (Lane A ∥ Lane B, image built once) |
| Release tag | ~60+ min | unchanged by design (full evidence) |
